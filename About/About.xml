Lets you change stuff for pawnkinds.
Started as a replacemet for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2020630826]Configurable Biocoding[/url] but started adding more properties to modify.

Currently implemented
[list]
[*] Biocode Chance
[*] Chemical Addiction Chance
[*] Combat Enhancing Drugs Chance
[*] Headgear Chance
[*] Tech Hediffs Chance
[*] Tech Hediffs Money

Changes are instant but will only affect pawns when they spawn.

If you have suggestions on more properties to change, leave a comment and Ill look into adding it.
