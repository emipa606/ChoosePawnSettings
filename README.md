Lets you change stuff for pawnkinds.
Started as a replacemet for https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2020630826]Configurable Biocoding but started adding more properties to modify.

Currently implemented


-  Biocode Chance
-  Chemical Addiction Chance
-  Combat Enhancing Drugs Chance
-  Tech Hediffs Chance
-  Tech Hediffs Money



Changes are instant but will only affect pawns when they spawn.

If you have suggestions on more properties to change, leave a comment and Ill look into adding it.
